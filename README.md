## FLOX

FLOX is a modular framework for building trading systems, written in modern C++.  
It provides low-level infrastructure for constructing execution pipelines, processing market data, managing strategy logic, and integrating with exchanges or storage backends. The framework is designed to be composable, testable, and suitable for both research and production environments.
