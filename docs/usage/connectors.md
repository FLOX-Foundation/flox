## Connectors

Flox provides a modular architecture that allows connectors to centralized and decentralized exchanges to be developed independently and plugged into the engine.

The **open-source community implementations of connectors built on top of Flox** are maintained in the following repository:

> [https://github.com/FLOX-Foundation/flox-connectors](https://github.com/FLOX-Foundation/flox-connectors)

This repository includes exchange connectors that:

* Connect to public and private WebSocket endpoints
* Publish market data into Flox event buses
* Route order requests via authenticated REST APIs
* Integrate with the core engine using low-latency infrastructure

Contributions are welcome. See the repository for implementation guidelines and examples.
