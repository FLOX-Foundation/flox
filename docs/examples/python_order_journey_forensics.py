"""Read OrderJourneyTracer analytics from Python.

Wiring note: in C++ `OrderJourneyTracer` is an `IOrderExecutionListener`
fed by `onOrderEvent` (see tests/test_order_journey_tracer.cpp). The
Python class exposes the collector and its analytics, but it is not an
`ExecutionListener` subclass, so `BacktestRunner.add_execution_listener`
does not accept it -- attach the tracer on the C++ side and read the
results here.
