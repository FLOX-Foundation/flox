## Walk-forward backtesting

Walk-forward splits the time series into successive train / test
windows, runs the strategy through each pair, and returns per-fold
stats. Useful as a sanity check on overfitting: if the strategy looks
great on the train half but degrades on the held-out test half across
folds, the backtest is overfit.

`flox_py.WalkForwardRunner` ships in Python. The same primitive is in
`flox.WalkForwardRunner` for Node and through the C ABI for Codon
(`flox_walk_forward_run_csv`).

## Modes

`anchored` — the train window starts at bar 0 and grows. Each fold
trains on `[0, t]`, tests on `[t, t + test_size]`, then `t` advances by
`step`. Set `min_train_size` to skip the first folds where the train
window is too small.

`sliding` — the train window is fixed-size and slides forward. Each
fold trains on `[t, t + train_size]`, tests on
`[t + train_size, t + train_size + test_size]`, `t` advances by `step`.

## Python

```python
import flox_py as flox

reg = flox.SymbolRegistry()
btc = reg.add_symbol("exchange", "BTCUSDT", 0.01)


class SmaCross(flox.Strategy):
    def __init__(self, syms):
        super().__init__(syms)
        self.fast = flox.SMA(10)
        self.slow = flox.SMA(30)

    def on_trade(self, ctx, t):
        f = self.fast.update(t.price)
        s = self.slow.update(t.price)
        if f is None or s is None or not self.slow.ready:
            return
        if f > s and ctx.is_flat():
            self.market_buy(0.01)
        elif f < s and ctx.is_long():
            self.close_position()


wfr = flox.WalkForwardRunner(
    reg, fee_rate=0.0004, initial_capital=10_000,
    mode="anchored", test_size=100, step=100, min_train_size=100,
)

# Factory called twice per fold (train, then test). Build a fresh
# strategy every time — state from a prior fold must not leak.
wfr.set_strategy_factory(lambda fold_index: SmaCross([btc]))

folds = wfr.run_csv("data/btcusdt_sample.csv", "BTCUSDT")
for f in folds:
    print(f"fold {f['fold_index']}: "
          f"train return={f['train_stats']['return_pct']:+.4f}% "
          f"sharpe={f['train_stats']['sharpe_ratio']:+.4f} | "
          f"test return={f['test_stats']['return_pct']:+.4f}% "
          f"sharpe={f['test_stats']['sharpe_ratio']:+.4f}")
```

The factory pattern is non-negotiable: the engine calls it once per
window with no shortcut for "reuse my strategy". A leaked indicator
buffer or position counter from a prior fold would silently corrupt
the next fold's stats.

## Node

```js
const flox = require('@flox-foundation/flox');

const reg = new flox.SymbolRegistry();
const btc = reg.addSymbol('exchange', 'BTCUSDT', 0.01);

const wfr = new flox.WalkForwardRunner(reg, 0.0004, 10000, {
  mode: 'anchored', testSize: 100, step: 100, minTrainSize: 100,
});

wfr.setStrategyFactory((foldIndex) => {
  const fast = new flox.SMA(10);
  const slow = new flox.SMA(30);
  return {
    symbols: [Number(btc)],
    onTrade(ctx, t, emit) {
      const f = fast.update(t.price);
      const s = slow.update(t.price);
      if (f === null || s === null || !slow.ready) return;
      if (f > s && ctx.position === 0) emit.marketBuy(0.01);
      else if (f < s && ctx.position > 0) emit.closePosition();
    },
  };
});

const folds = wfr.runCsv('data/btcusdt_sample.csv', 'BTCUSDT');
folds.forEach(f => console.log(f.foldIndex, f.testStats.returnPct));
```

## What you get back per fold

```
{
  "fold_index": 0,
  "train_start_bar": 0, "train_end_bar": 100,
  "test_start_bar": 100, "test_end_bar": 200,
  "train_start_ns": ..., "train_end_ns": ...,
  "test_start_ns": ..., "test_end_ns": ...,
  "train_stats": { ... full BacktestStats ... },
  "test_stats":  { ... full BacktestStats ... },
}
```

The two `*_stats` blocks are the same shape as `BacktestRunner.run_csv`
returns. Compute aggregate statistics (mean / median / variance over
folds) on the client side — the runner does not aggregate for you on
purpose, since useful aggregates depend on what you are looking for
(robustness vs. average performance vs. worst case).

## Full OHLCV path for `on_bar` strategies

`run_csv` replays close prices as synthetic trade events — `on_trade`
fires, but `on_bar` does not, and intrabar high / low / volume are
not preserved. For strategies whose decisions depend on bar internals
(TP/SL ladders on high/low, ATR-style indicators, breakout filters),
use `run_bars` with numpy arrays:

```python
import flox_py as flox
import numpy as np

reg = flox.SymbolRegistry()
btc = reg.add_symbol("exchange", "BTCUSDT", 0.01)


class IntrabarBreakout(flox.Strategy):
    def __init__(self, syms):
        super().__init__(syms)
        self.in_pos = False

    def on_bar(self, ctx, bar):
        if not self.in_pos and bar.high >= bar.open * 1.005:
            self.market_buy(0.01)
            self.in_pos = True
        elif self.in_pos and bar.low <= bar.open * 0.99:
            self.market_sell(0.01)
            self.in_pos = False


wfr = flox.WalkForwardRunner(
    reg, fee_rate=0.0, initial_capital=10_000,
    mode="sliding", train_size=4380, test_size=2190, step=2190,
)
wfr.set_strategy_factory(lambda _i: IntrabarBreakout([btc]))

# OHLCV arrays — all must have the same length, sorted by end_time_ns.
start_ns = ...  # int64 ns, bar open
end_ns = ...    # int64 ns, bar close
open_, high, low, close, volume = ...  # float64

folds = wfr.run_bars(
    start_ns, end_ns, open_, high, low, close, volume,
    symbol="BTCUSDT")
```

Each fold dispatches `BarEvent`s with full OHLCV preserved. `on_bar`
fires; `on_trade` does not — same convention as
`BacktestRunner.run_bars`. `bar_type` (default `0` = Time) and
`bar_type_param` are forwarded for non-time bar aggregations.

## Optimising per fold (C++)

Give the C++ runner a parameter grid and a factory that takes parameters, and
each fold becomes a walk-forward optimisation: every grid point is run on the
train slice, the points are ranked, and the test slice runs on the winner.

```cpp
WalkForwardRunner runner(backtestConfig, wfConfig);

// One axis of candidate values per parameter; the runner walks the
// cartesian product, last axis varying fastest.
runner.setParameterGrid({{10.0, 20.0, 50.0}, {1.5, 2.0}});

runner.setStrategyFactory(
    [&](std::size_t foldIndex, const std::vector<double>& params) -> IStrategy*
    {
      // params[0] from the first axis, params[1] from the second.
      return makeStrategy(params[0], static_cast<int>(params[1]));
    });

const auto folds = runner.run(bars);
// folds[i].trainStats is the winning point's in-sample result;
// folds[i].testStats is that same point, out of sample.
```

Points are ranked on `net_pnl` — what the window kept after fees — and a tie
goes to the earlier grid point, so the selection is deterministic. The
factory is called once per grid point on the train slice and once more with
the winning point, so the out-of-sample run starts from clean strategy state.
Returning `nullptr` skips a point; a fold whose every grid point the
factory declines is reported empty — zeroed train and test stats and a
warning naming the fold — and the folds after it still run.

A factory that takes only a fold index keeps the older behaviour: one
strategy per window, no search. Setting a grid alongside that shape is
reported in the log and ignored — nothing could carry a parameter into the
strategy.

## What walk-forward does not do

The per-fold optimisation above is C++ only. The Python and Node runners
still take a fold-index factory and run one strategy per window; to optimise
from a binding, run [grid search](grid-search.md) on each fold's train slice
yourself and evaluate the winner on test.

The runner also has no pluggable objective: the in-sample ranking is
`net_pnl`. Rank on Sharpe or drawdown by composing the grid-search primitives
instead.
