# Rehearse, by hand, the install-and-import gate that node-publish.yml and
# python-wheels.yml now run before publishing. Takes an already-built npm
# tarball (`npm pack` output), an already-built Python wheel, and/or an
# already-built Python sdist; this script does not build any of them -- it
# only proves that what would go to the registry actually installs and
# loads on this machine.
#
# This is the check that would have caught the flat prebuilds/flox_node.node
# bug: every npm publish since 0.7.1 shipped a package whose prebuilds/
# directory held one file that overwrote all three platform artifacts on
# download, while node/index.js requires prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>/..., so
# `require('@flox-foundation/flox')` failed on every install. Nothing in the
# old workflow ever ran that require -- publish went straight from
# download-artifact to `npm publish`.
#
# --sdist is the slow one: it runs a real source build (cmake configures the
# whole project and compiles the core plus the extension), which is the only
# thing that can tell a self-contained sdist from one that merely looks
# populated.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check_published_package.sh --npm-tarball PATH [--wheel PATH]
#   scripts/check_published_package.sh --wheel PATH [--npm-tarball PATH]
#   scripts/check_published_package.sh --sdist PATH
#
# At least one of --npm-tarball / --wheel / --sdist is required. Exit status
# is nonzero if any requested check fails.
