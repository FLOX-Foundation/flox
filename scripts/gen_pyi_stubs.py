scripts/gen_pyi_stubs.py

Regenerate `python/flox_py/__init__.pyi` and `python/flox_py/targets.pyi`
from the built `flox_py` extension via pybind11-stubgen.

Without committed stubs, type checkers (mypy, pyright) and AI agents
(Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot) treat the pybind11 module as opaque and
hallucinate method names. Committed stubs + a CI sync gate close that
gap; the generated `.pyi` files ship inside the wheel via
`python/flox_py/`, so PyPI users get types automatically (PEP 561 marker
is `python/flox_py/py.typed`).

The script imports `flox_py` from `build/python` (set by
`PYTHONPATH=build/python` if not already importable) — flox_py must be
built first, e.g. `cmake --build build --target _flox_py`.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/gen_pyi_stubs.py            # write
    python3 scripts/gen_pyi_stubs.py --check    # exit 1 if stubs drift
