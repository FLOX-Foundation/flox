"""The gates only gate what CI actually runs.

The parity step ran without `--require-quickjs` and said so in a comment
("turn it on here once the manifest is complete"), which left 59 of 73 IDL
groups unchecked against the QuickJS layer while the step reported success.
A flag that exists and is never passed is not a gate.
