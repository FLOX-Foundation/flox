"""What the Python binding owes a callback that raises.

Three separate contracts live in this file, all of them about a Python
exception meeting the C ABI.

1. A pre-trade gate (RiskManager / KillSwitch / OrderValidator) whose
   Python callable raises must fail *closed*.

   `include/flox/capi/flox_capi_spec.hpp:2306` fixes what the two return
   values mean:

       "Returning 0 (deny) drops the signal entirely; returning 1 (allow)
        lets it propagate."

   and `include/flox/capi/flox_capi.h:47` fixes what a call that could
   not complete has to do:

       "Exceptions. None escape. The engine underneath is C++ and throws;
        unwinding out of a frame with C linkage is undefined behaviour, so
        every function on this page catches. A call that was stopped this
        way returns its failure value and leaves a description behind:
        flox_last_error_code() and flox_last_error_message() report it for
        the calling thread."

   A gate that raised did not complete, so the two halves of that
   sentence apply to it: it returns *its failure value*, which for a gate
   is 0 = deny, and it leaves a description behind. The Python binding
   exposes no `flox_last_error_*` accessor (`grep -n last_error
   python/*.h python/*.cpp` is empty), so "leaves a description behind"
   can only reach a Python caller two ways: the exception is re-raised
   out of the call that drove the gate, or it is reported through the
   binding's own error path, `flox_py.set_log_callback` (the C API's
   "Logger -- process-wide log redirection callback"). This file accepts
   either, and requires one of them.

   Today neither half holds: `python/hook_bindings.h:364` (also `:420`,
   `:475`) pre-initialises `uint8_t result = 1` and `invokeUnderGil`
   (`:220`) swallows the exception, so a raising gate returns ALLOW and
   says nothing.

2. A strategy callback that raises must not take the process or the
   engine with it. `python/hook_bindings.h:216` states the rule the
   sibling header does not follow:

       "Exceptions from Python are caught and printed -- propagating them
        across the C ABI boundary is undefined behaviour."

   `python/strategy_bindings.h` has no `catch` at all, so the nine
   callbacks registered at `:774-:782` let a Python exception unwind
   through a C function pointer.

3. `Runner.on_trade` / `on_book_snapshot` / `on_bar`
   (`python/strategy_bindings.h:2991-:2995`) publish into an EventBus
   that busy-waits on consumer gating once the ring is full
   (`include/flox/util/eventing/event_bus.h:747`), and they do it holding
   the GIL. The consumer thread needs the GIL to finish the Python
   callback that would drain the ring, so the two threads wedge.

Every subprocess case runs under a wall-clock timeout so a wedge is
reported as a failure instead of hanging the suite; a timeout is also the
only safe way to observe an aborted process.
